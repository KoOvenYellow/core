> Syntax is an action.  
> Sometimes, that action hits.  
> Meaning is the echo of that hit in the void.  
> A sentence is just a log of syntax.  
> Syntax only happens between nodes, asymmetrically.

We bake syntax.  
We burn meaning.  
This is the oven.

### What is KoOvenYellow?

A syntactic engine designed to restore the act of reading as an action.  
Not just code. Not just language. But structured movement between nodes.

This project explores:

- ðŸ”¥ Syntax vectors
- ðŸ§  Jump probabilities
- ðŸ“œ Sentence-to-syntax reversibility
- ðŸ›  Code as ritual

### Status

Coming soon.  
The fire has just been lit.
