> A sentence is just a log of syntax.  
> Syntax only happens between nodes, asymmetrically.

We bake syntax.  
We burn meaning.  
This is the oven.

### 🧭 Project Structure

This repository contains the prototype of a syntactic engine.  
It is not designed to process language.  
It is designed to restore **the act of syntax as movement between nodes**.

├── syndo/ # Core logic for syntax-based jump evaluation
├── irpc_evaluator.py # Jump evaluator engine
├── irpc_jump.py # Execution logic
├── llm_select_with_syndo.py # LLM scoring using IRPC
├── .env.example # 🔐 Environment variable template
├── .gitignore # Noise filter
└── README.md # This file

### 🧪 Setup

To test or extend this engine:

1. Copy the template environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   
2. Fill in the required variables (e.g. OPENAI_API_KEY)

3. Run any module:
   python3 irpc_jump.py
   
🔧 Dependencies
Python 3.8+

Optional:

sentence-transformers

openai

Other libraries based on your .env setup

🧠 Notes
This is not a model.
This is a structure.
Syntax is the shadow of movement.
Execution is the echo of its intent.


### What is KoOvenYellow?

A syntactic engine designed to restore the act of reading as an action.  
Not just code. Not just language. But structured movement between nodes.

This project explores:

- 🔥 Syntax vectors
- 🧠 Jump probabilities
- 📜 Sentence-to-syntax reversibility
- 🛠 Code as ritual
